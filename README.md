# GP-ex0

A collection of graphics programming exercises to build knowledge.
The idea is to build features over time and progress to a small real time renderer.

Features:
* Runs on GPU with OpenGL.
* GUI is `imgui`.
* Basic image compositing.
* Load and display meshes.
* Add lights.

## To run
Open solution in `examples`, build and run the `opengl3` example.
